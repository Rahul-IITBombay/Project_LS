 Twitter Sentiment Analysis- using XLNet (Pre-trained model and Gradio)
 (Problem Statement)- "To detect hate speech in tweets"
 Label ‘1’ denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and 
 Label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using the XLNet model, integrated with the Gradio library for creating a user-friendly web interface.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a given text. In this project, we use the XLNet model, a transformer-based architecture, to perform sentiment analysis on tweets and predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The Gradio library is used to create an interactive web interface that allows users to input a tweet and receive the sentiment prediction along with a confidence score.
